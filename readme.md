#Little Cottonwood Canyon Road Status

***

Written in Java

November 2015 && March 2016



I whipped up this quick script to run from a .bat file so that I can quickly and easily retrieve the status of 
the roads that weave through Little Cottonwood Canyon up to Snowbird. 

I have found it very useful for when I am considering going skiing but I suspect the roads may be bad.

In March 2016, I made a quick Android version for personal use.
