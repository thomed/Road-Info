Little Cottonwood Canyon Road Status

During ski season, I often check the status of the roads 
that lead from the base of Little Cottonwood Canyon up to
Snowbird. The most accurate way to do this is to visit the
CommuterLink website that displays road conditions and 
restrictions for the major roads throughout Utah. 

However, because I get lazy, it can become a pain to always
open up my browser, navigate to the proper website, and 
scroll past dozens of other roads in search of the two that
I'm interested in.

This program not only simplifies the process, but gave me 
the opportunity to try something new. It pulls the HTML from
the website and searches for the roads I desire then prints
the current status to the console (no GUI). Implementation 
was quick and usage is limited, but I have found it to be 
very useful for my needs.
